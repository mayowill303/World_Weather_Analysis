# World_Weather_Analysis
•	Perform tasks using new Python libraries and modules.
•	Retrieve and use data from an API "get" request to a server.
•	Retrieve and store values from a JSON array.
•	Use try and except blocks to resolve errors.
•	Write Python functions.
•	Create scatter plots using the Matplotlib library, and apply styles and features to a plot.
•	Perform linear regression, and add regression lines to scatter plots.
•	Create heatmaps, and add markers using the Google Maps API.

Project Plan
Here's an outline of your project plan:
•	Task: Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide.
•	Purpose: PlanMyTrip will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.
•	Method: Create a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data.
Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers love it too. And, as with any new product, they’ve recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. 
•	Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data you’ve already retrieved in this module. 
•	Then, you'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 
•	From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. 
•	Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
